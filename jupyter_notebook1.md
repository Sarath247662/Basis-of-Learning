# Jupyter notebook stuff

Basically, Jupyter notebooks are used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations and visualizations. It is used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

### Getting Started

- Jupyter notebook comes installed with the Anaconda packages.

- After installing Anaconda, just launch the Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda navigator. Just type in the terminal:

```sh

- It shows you the directories. Click on 'New' and create a python3 jupter notebook and open it to get started.

- it should look like this

- Try experimenting with functions while writing bits of code and text

- You can seperately run each cell.

- Output can be not just text, but tables, figures, graphs depending on the code and libraries imported.

- You can import a ton of libraries and read about each of their documentations and features. eg.-


```python
import pandas
import matplotlib
```
